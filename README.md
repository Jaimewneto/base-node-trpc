# Take a look at this beauty (still under progress)

My intent with this repo is to create a basis to build end to end typescript aplications quickly.

More specifically, extremely strongly typed, modular, and flexible aplications.

It's a tRPC project at heart.

I've looked for the most apropriate libraries to do each thing I needed (full typescript ones)
(routing, auth handling, querying and so on)

Feel free to suggest things and open PRs (and obviously, using this as you wish).

By the way, till now I've only made the server part. Looking foward to start client soon.

## How to install
